After adding a renter, you can track his payments. 

For adding the payment of a renter you just need to:

**_select the renter_** -> **_click on add payment button_** -> **_fill the details_** -> **_click the save button_**

I have provided every possible fields in the payment which you can fill and keep track of.

After adding payment once, the next time you add payment, everything is prefilled automatically based on the previous payment. If you need you can edit the fields.

### Borrowers

In this category you can keep track of your borrowers (the person to whom you have lend some money.)

First of all you will need to add the details of the borrower.

You can easily do it, just :

**_go to borrower screen_** -> **_tap on the add (+) button_** -> **_fill the details of the borrower_** -> **_click on the save button**_

After adding the borrower, you will have to add the borrowed amount details; you just need to follow the steps as you did for adding the payments of the renter. There is an additional feature here, i.e. you can add a supporting document (of type : pdf, image and url) to your borrower payment.

After adding the borrower payment, you can mark it finish by either marking it as complete or you add **partial payments** and the payment will be complete once it is equal to to the borrowed amount.
